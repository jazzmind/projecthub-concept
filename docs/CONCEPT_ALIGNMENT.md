# Concept Alignment Summary

## Changes Made to Align Specs with Architecture

### **Conceptual Model Updates**

#### **Removed Concepts:**
1. **Expert** - Replaced with generic Profile concept
2. **IndustryPartner** - Now a role, not a separate concept

#### **Added Concepts:**
1. **Profile** - Generic extended user information concept
   - Supports multiple profile types (expert, industry_partner, etc.)
   - Links to User via userEntity field
   - Includes skills, languages, ratings, and verification
   - Modeled after concept design principles for reusability

#### **Updated Concepts:**
1. **Role** - Clarified that expert and industry_partner are roles
   - Added documentation about standard platform roles
   - Added Permissions entity for granular access control

2. **User** - Updated operational principle to clarify relationship with Profile

### **Key Architecture Alignments**

#### **1. Role-Based Design**
- **IndustryPartner** is now a role assigned via Membership, not a separate concept
- **Expert** is now a role assigned via Membership, not a separate concept
- Users can have multiple profiles for different roles
- Extended information stored in Profile entities

#### **2. Generic Reusability**
- Profile concept can support any role type
- ProfileSkill and ProfileLanguage as separate entities for flexibility
- Follows SSF (Simple State Form) syntax properly

#### **3. Proper Entity Relationships**
```
User --[Membership]--> Organization/Team/Project (with Role)
User --[1:N]--> Profile (extended info for specific roles)
Profile --[1:N]--> ProfileSkill
Profile --[1:N]--> ProfileLanguage
```

### **Database Schema Updates**

#### **Added Models:**
- `Profile` - Main profile information
- `ProfileSkill` - Skills with expertise levels and experience
- `ProfileLanguage` - Language proficiencies

#### **Removed Models:**
- `Expert` - Replaced by Profile with profileType="expert"
- `IndustryPartner` - Replaced by Profile with profileType="industry_partner"

### **Synchronization Updates**

#### **Added Sync Files:**
- `profiles.sync` - Complete Profile management workflows
  - Profile creation/update with permission checks
  - Skill and language management
  - Profile verification workflows
  - Automatic profile creation for role assignments
  - Expert matching for projects

#### **Updated Sync Files:**
- `rbac.sync` - Added InitializePlatformRoles sync with standard roles
- `README.md` - Updated documentation to include profiles

### **TypeScript Implementation**

#### **Created:**
- `src/lib/concepts/profile.ts` - Full Profile concept implementation
  - Proper Prisma integration
  - All actions and queries from specification
  - Error handling following concept patterns

#### **Removed:**
- `src/lib/concepts/expert.ts`
- `src/lib/concepts/industryPartner.ts`

### **Standard Platform Roles**

The system now properly defines these standard roles:

1. **platform_admin** - Full platform access (scope: platform)
2. **org_admin** - Organization management (scope: organization)  
3. **educator** - Educational content management (scope: campaign)
4. **expert** - Project guidance and feedback (scope: project)
5. **industry_partner** - Industry collaboration (scope: project)
6. **team_leader** - Team leadership (scope: team)
7. **learner** - Learning participation (scope: team)

### **Benefits of This Approach**

#### **1. Concept Design Compliance**
- Each concept serves a single, clear purpose
- No dependencies between concepts
- Reusable across different domains
- Follows SSF syntax properly

#### **2. Architectural Correctness**
- Roles are properly separated from entity concepts
- Hierarchical RBAC works as documented
- Generic Profile supports any role type
- Proper separation of concerns

#### **3. Implementation Consistency**
- Specs are source of truth
- TypeScript implementations follow spec exactly
- Database schema matches concept specifications
- Synchronizations handle all specified workflows

### **Next Steps**

To complete the alignment:

1. **Update existing sync registrations** to include Profile concept
2. **Test profile workflows** with real data
3. **Update UI components** to use Profile instead of Expert
4. **Run database migration** to apply schema changes
5. **Update any remaining references** to Expert/IndustryPartner concepts

### **Migration Path**

For existing data:
1. Create Profile entities for existing Expert/IndustryPartner records
2. Migrate skills/expertise to ProfileSkill entities
3. Update Membership records to use proper role names
4. Remove old Expert/IndustryPartner tables

This approach ensures the codebase follows concept design principles while maintaining the documented architectural patterns.
