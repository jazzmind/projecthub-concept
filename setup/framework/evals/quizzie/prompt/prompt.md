## Initial prompt

Carefully reason through, plan, and build the following: A complete working
application for Quizzie, a Slido-inspired application for simple online quizzes
to share based on URLs.

- Write `.concept` specifications under ./specs
- Write `.ts` concept implementations under ./concepts
- Write `.ts` synchronizations under ./syncs
- You may use any other structure to setup the full stack application and hook
  into the concept design system.

The specific requirements, including images of the design, are as follows:

@main.png

Main page: when user is logged in, shows list of the quizzes they have created.
User name handle in top right offers standard dropdown menu with logout.
Actions:

- Delete quiz (click on trashcan next to quiz name)
- Add new quiz (enter name in text area and click on plus) Navigation:
- Clicking on Quizzie takes you back to home page (this page)
- Clicking on quiz name takes you to quiz page

@quiz.png

Quiz page: shows the questions and options in a quiz, and includes functions for
editing the quiz and activating it etc. Actions: • Delete question (click on
trashcan next to question text) • Delete option (click on trashcan next to
option text) • Edit question text (click in text area) • Edit option text (click
in text area) • Add new question (enter text and click plus) • Add new option
(enter text and click plus) • Activate question (opens up new tab with displayed
question) • Deactivate question (stops accepting votes) • Show results (shows
number of votes on displayed question page) • Hide results (hides number of
votes on displayed question page) Navigation: • Clicking on Quizzie takes you
back to home page

@question.png

Question page: shows a question along with a QR code (so this page can be
displayed to an audience), and will also show results when enabled. When an
audience member follows the QR code, they get a page with exactly the same
structure. Count shows A/B, where A is the number of users that have selected
that option and B is the total number of users that have interacted in this
activation session so far. Actions: • Select option (click to left of option
text) • Poll vote count (polls server to update displayed counts) Navigation: •
Clicking on Quizzie takes you to home page

## Fixing underspecification

The original specification contained a number of underspecified parts that the
LLM faithfully replicated, but are not desirable. Here are some attempts at
rectifying it:

### Original specification is ambiguous about the single question display

The displayed quiz page shows only one question, and the QR code seems invalid.

Response:

```
I inspected the client and API flow. The “show” control on quiz.html was opening the active single question page (question.html?activation=...), which explains why you only see one question. The QR uses location.origin (localhost), which phones can’t reach, so it appears invalid.
What I changed
Display all questions
Added a “display” button in web/quiz.js to open question.html?quiz=<quizId> so the page lists every question in the quiz and lets users vote on the currently activated ones.
Hide counts unless results are shown
Updated web/question.js to only show vote counts when showResults is true (both for activation view and full-quiz view).
Fix QR “invalid” in real use
In web/question.js, the activation page now shows the share URL and a small “Share base” input to override localhost with your LAN IP. The QR regenerates using this base, so phones can scan it successfully on your network.
```

### Tidying up the page and actually specifying question navigation

Let's call the display page the overview page, get rid of the tip for the QR
code thing, and try to visually group the share base and url hint in a nice way
together on the right hand side with the QR code. Let's solve the problem of the
single question by allowing there to be some navigation between the questions of
the same quiz. This way, the overview page can be an at a glance of all the quiz
results.

Response:

```
I renamed the button to open the overview page and wired it to show all questions for the quiz.
I removed the QR tip. The QR, share base input, and URL are now grouped in a right-aligned share panel.
I added Prev/Next navigation on the single-question page to move across questions in the same quiz. It auto-activates the next/prev if needed.
The overview page shows vote counts for all questions at a glance. The single-question page still hides counts unless results are shown.
What changed
web/quiz.js: button text now “overview”; opens question.html?quiz=<quizId>.
web/question.js:
Activation view:
Right-side share panel (.share-panel) with QR, base input, and URL (no tip).
Prev/Next navigation across questions in the same quiz; auto-activates target if not active.
Counts still respect showResults.
Overview view (when opened with ?quiz=): shows all questions with counts regardless of showResults.
web/styles.css: styles for .share-panel and tweaks to keep it aligned right.
syncs/api_quiz.ts: activation payload now includes quiz to enable navigation.
You can now:
Use “overview” to monitor all results at once.
Use the single-question view to navigate between questions while presenting, keeping the QR and share target grouped neatly on the right.
```

### Results on second question onwards disappearing

Great, but the second question of a quiz doesn't display the results anymore

Response:

```
Thanks — I see why. When navigating to the next question, we were activating it but not ensuring results were shown. I updated the navigation so if the current question is showing results, the next/prev will automatically call “show” after activation before navigating.
What I changed
web/question.js:
Prev/Next handlers now pass the current showResults state.
navigateSibling(...) will POST /api/activations/:activation/show for the target question if the current one was showing results.
Impact
Moving from Q1 to Q2 now preserves the “show results” state, so Q2 displays results immediately.
```
